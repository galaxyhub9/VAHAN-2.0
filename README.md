## 📈 key Investor Insights I discovered


| Segment | Insight |
|---------|---------|
| **EV Market** | EVs form only **2.5%** of total registrations, showing huge growth potential but still early-stage adoption. |
| **Two-Wheelers** | **74.2%** of all registrations are two-wheelers, highlighting a larger and more stable market than passenger cars. |
